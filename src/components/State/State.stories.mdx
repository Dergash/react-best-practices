# State

Everything in React rolls around the concept of state.

In the past everything rolled around URLs. Requests were made to them and responses received. This was called AJAX, REST, CRUD, MVC and so forth. Now one has to [forget all these](https://kentcdodds.com/chats-with-kent-podcast/seasons/01/episodes/realigning-your-model-of-react-after-hooks-with-dan-abramov) to be able to think the React way.

By definition, in React one has to:

> Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. &mdash; via [Reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/)

The keywords are design and state vs. request and response.

Designing apps with React happens on the front-end / user interface and the back-end is completely ignored in this process. In the past the design happened on the backend &mdash; API first, Model and Controller first &mdash; then the user interface was constructed around.

With state React introduces a powerful mechanism to manage all kind of changes on the user interface &mdash; coming either from user interactions or from the underlying network and services infrastucture.

In the past there were no such mechanisms at all. There were ad-hoc solutions like connecting content - presentation - behavior (HTML - CSS - Javascript) through naming conventions (class names) &mdash; all proved to be impossible to scale.

Now React puts a mathematical model of computation &mdash; [finite-state machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) &mdash; as the core and sole basis of application design and development. With that new perspectives are opened &mdash; from data-driven applications to autogenerating tests.
