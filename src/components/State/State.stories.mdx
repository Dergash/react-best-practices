# State

Everything in React rolls around the concept of state.

In the past everything rolled around URLs. Requests were made to them and responses received. This was called AJAX, REST, CRUD, MVC and so forth. Now one has to [forget all these](https://kentcdodds.com/chats-with-kent-podcast/seasons/01/episodes/realigning-your-model-of-react-after-hooks-with-dan-abramov) to be able to think the React way.

By definition, in React one has to:

> Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. &mdash; via [Reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/)

The main concern in React is to manage application state instead of managing requests and responsonses from external sources.

To put another way &mdash; designing apps now happens on the front-end / user interface and the back-end is rendered non-relevant in this process. In the past the design happened on the backend &mdash; API first &mdash; then a user interface was constructed around.
