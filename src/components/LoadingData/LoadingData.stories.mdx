# Loading data

Perhaps every React app deals with data. It loads from a database, from an API, from the filesystem &mdash; you name it.

There are two well established ways to make interacting with data easy: `GraphQL` and `REST API`.

`GraphQL` is the [modern way](http://metamn.io/react/graphql-and-rest-apis-with-aws/). It enables data driven applications. `REST` is &mdash; still &mdash; based on old, web-specific paradigms like `URL` and `CRUD`.

On both fronts there are clear winner libraries to rely.

`Apollo` for GraphQL and `Axios` for REST APIs. Both of them work more or less in the same way making easy to a React developer to abstract away their differences.

## Performance

Fetching data from remote location is considered a time consuming task which needs to be optimized.

Modern tools, frameworks and services are competing to solve this problem for us. In modern times we don't have to think about performance optimizations &mdash; just stick to the standards and let the magic happen under the hood.

### Apollo GraphQL

Apollo GraphQL is such a modern tool. For example:

> Apollo Client takes care of the request cycle from start to finish, including tracking loading and error states for you. There's no middleware to set up or boilerplate to write before making your first request, nor do you need to worry about transforming and caching the response. All you have to do is describe the data your component needs and let Apollo Client do the heavy lifting. ðŸ’ª

> You'll find that when you switch to Apollo Client, you'll be able to delete a lot of unnecessary code related to data management. The exact amount will vary depending on your application, but some teams have reported up to thousands of lines. While you'll find yourself writing less code with Apollo, that doesn't mean you have to compromise on features! Advanced features like optimistic UI, refetching, and pagination are all easily accessible through useQuery options.

> Just by setting up Apollo Client, you get an intelligent cache out of the box with no additional configuration required. [...] Caching a graph is no easy task, but we've spent two years focused on solving it.

And the list [continues](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/why-apollo/).

### Axios REST API

In [AJAX and APIs](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-ajax.html) React officially recommends using Axios. In [How to fetch data in React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-fetching-data/) Robin Wieruch &mdash; one of the React thought leaders &mdash; recommends Axios.

Checking [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) we might be surprised. Unlike Apollo for GraphQL it tells nothing about data, caching and performance. It just tells: "Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js"

To make performant REST API operations one has to look further.

## Placeholders

Loading data is a time consuming operation lasting from miliseconds to seconds. To make this delay unobtrusive on the UI placeholders are used as a best practice.

There are different types of placeholders from spinners, `Loading...` text to complete monochromatic mockups as seen lately on Facebook and Instagram.

The best placeholder is no placeholder. Next to it is the one which mimics exactly the shape of the real data and produces no surprise &mdash; subtle cognitive dissonance &mdash; when the real data arrives.
