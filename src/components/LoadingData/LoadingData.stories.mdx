# Loading data

Perhaps every React app deals with data. It loads from a database, from an API, from the filesystem &mdash; you name it.

There are two well established ways to make interacting with data easy: `GraphQL` and `REST API`.

`GraphQL` is the [modern way](http://metamn.io/react/graphql-and-rest-apis-with-aws/). It enables data driven applications. `REST` is &mdash; still &mdash; based on old, web-specific paradigms like `URL` and `CRUD`.

On both fronts there are clear winner libraries to rely.

`Apollo` for GraphQL and `Axios` for REST APIs. Both of them work more or less in the same way making easy to a React developer to abstract away their differences.

## Performance

Fetching data from remote location is considered a time consuming task which needs to be optimized.

Modern tools, frameworks and services are competing to solve this problem for us. In modern times we don't have to think about performance optimizations &mdash; just stick to the standards and let the magic happen under the hood.

## Placeholders

Loading data is a time consuming operation lasting from miliseconds to seconds. To make this delay unobtrusive on the UI placeholders are used as a best practice.

There are different types of placeholders from spinners, simple `Loading...` text to complete monochromatic mockups as seen lately on Facebook and Instagram.

The best one is which mimics exactly the shape of the real data and produces no surprise &mdash; subtle cognitive dissonance &mdash; when the real data arrives.
