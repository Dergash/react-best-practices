# React best practices

An ongoing experiment on React best practices. Since Hooks.

## Introduction

Among modern frameworks React is the one which feels truly complete.

Ditching the concept of web in favor of user interface and betting all on a real programming language &mdash; makes UI design and development with React highly integrated and all around programmable.

There are lots of things to learn &mdash; React is famous about its steep learning curve. No wonder. From servers to user interactions introduces changes which are paradigm shifts.

A surprisingly compact ecosystem around React makes learning enjoyable. There are a handful of opinion leaders who share often their thoughts which are happen to be in line.

The list goes:

1. [Robin Wieruch](https://www.robinwieruch.de/)
2. [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/)
3. [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/)
4. [Dave Ceddia](https://daveceddia.com/)

This project tries to distill findings from these fine folks and document the outcome of the implementation of these findings.
