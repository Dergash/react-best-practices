# React best practices

An ongoing experiment on React best practices. Since Hooks.

## Introduction

Among modern frameworks React is the one which feels truly complete.

Ditching the concept of web in favor of user interface and betting all on a real programming language &mdash; makes UI design and development with React highly integrated and all around programmable.

A surprisingly compact ecosystem around React makes learning enjoyable. There are a handful of opinion leaders who share often their thoughts which are happen to be in line.

This project tries to distill all these findings and offer working code and documentation.
