# React best practices

An ongoing experiment on React best practices. Since Hooks, more exactly function components.

## Introduction

Among modern frameworks React is the one which feels truly complete.

By ditching the concept of web in favor of user interface and betting all on a real programming language &mdash; React made UI design and development highly integrated and all around programmable.

There are lots of things to learn &mdash; React is famous about its steep learning curve. No wonder. From servers to user interaction changes are introduced which are often paradigm shifts.

A surprisingly compact ecosystem around React makes learning enjoyable. There are a handful of opinion leaders who share often their thoughts which are happen to be in line.

The list goes:

1. [Robin Wieruch](https://www.robinwieruch.de/)
2. [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/)
3. [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/)
4. [Dave Ceddia](https://daveceddia.com/)

This project tries to distill findings from these fine folks and the larger ecosystem into working code and extensive documentation. To aid transition from the old URL-driven web to data driven apps.

## Loading data

Perhaps every React app deals with data.

- **Topics**: Performance, Placeholders, Pagination, Error handling, Cancellation, Testing

- **Technologies**: Apollo GraphQL, Axios REST API, SVG placeholders

A general problem solved elegantly. Also for React.

- **Topics**: Image resizing, Image compression, Image conversion, Responsiveness, Intrinsic ratio, Progressive image placeholder, Lazy loading, CDN

- **Technologies**: Cloudimage
