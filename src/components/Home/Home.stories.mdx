# React best practices

An ongoing experiment on React best practices.

## 1. Loading data

Perhaps every React app deals with data.

It loads from a database, from an API, from the filesystem &mdash; you name it. Even happens to an app to update or add new data.

There are two well established ways to make interacting with data easy: `GraphQL` and `REST API`.

`GraphQL` is the [modern way](http://metamn.io/react/graphql-and-rest-apis-with-aws/). It enables data driven applications versus `REST` which still uses old, web-specific paradigms like `URL` and `CRUD`.

On both fronts there are clear winner libraries to rely. `Apollo` for GraphQL and `Axios` for REST APIs. Both of them work more or less in the same way making easy to a React developer to abstract away their differences.

### 1.1 Performance

#### 1.1.1 Apollo GraphQL

#### 1.1.2 Axios REST API

### 1.2 Placeholders

Loading data is a time consuming operation lasting from miliseconds to seconds. To make this delay unobtrusive on the UI placeholders are used as a best practice.

There are different types of placeholders from spinners, simple `Loading...` text to complete monochromatic mockups as seen lately on Facebook and Instagram.

The best one is which mimics exactly the shape of the real data and produces no surprise &mdash; subtle cognitive dissonance &mdash; when the real data arrives.

#### 1.2.1 Default values as placeholders

#### 1.2.2 SVG mockups as placeholders

### 1.3 Pagination

### 1.4 Error handling

### 1.5 Cancellation

### 1.6 Testing
