# React best practices

An ongoing experiment on React best practices. Since Hooks.

## Introduction

Among modern frameworks React is the one which feels truly complete.

Ditching the concept of web in favor of user interface and betting all on a real programming language makes UI design and development with React highly integrated and all around programmable. A feature unseen before.

React is famous about its steep learning curve. No wonder. There are lots of things to learn &mdash; from servers to user interactions &mdash; and many of them are a paradigm shift.

A surprisingly compact ecosystem around React makes best practices easily extractable. There are a handful of opinion leaders who share their thoughts which are in line.

This project tries to distill all these and offer working code and documentation.
