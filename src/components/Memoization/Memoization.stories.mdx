# Memoization

In other words: caching components and functions.

[Loading data](./?path=/docs/loading-data--default-values-as-placeholders-loading-state) and [images](./?path=/docs/loading-images--art-direction-with-cloudinary) leverages the power of caching using third party solutions. For components and functions we have built-in mechanism provided by React out of the box: `React.memo()` and `useMemo()`, `useCallback()`.

## Caching components

Introduced rencently `React.memo()`:

> Bails out components from rendering when their input props are the same

That makes one think why don't memoize every component? The answer is: [avoid premature optimizations](./?path=/docs/memoization--storybookdocsonly). React is fast enough and every code added in plus might cause more harm than benefit.

### Measure first

A good starting point to see which component might need memoization is to use the React profiler.

<LoadingImages
  images={false}
  src="memoization-1.png"
  alt="The React profiler"
/>

`Repeat`, `Meta` and `TypographicGrid` are the components specific to this app &mdash; written by hand &mdash; which are the most time consuming among their peers.

Their loading times are:

```
| Component       | Loading time (ms)                         | Average |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|---------|
|                 | 1st load | 2nd load | 3rd load | 4th load |         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Repeat          | 3.7, 3.1 | 4.0, 3.8 | 13 , 2.6 | 4.2, 2.6 | 4.625   |
| Meta            | 0.8      | 1.4      | 1        | 1.3      | 1.125   |
| TypographicGrid | 0.7      | 0.8      | 4.5      | 0.8      | 1.7     |
```

Memoizing them brings in the following results:

```
| Component       | Loading time (ms)                         | Average |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|---------|
|                 | 1st load | 2nd load | 3rd load | 4th load |         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Repeat          | 2.5, 2.4 | 3.1, 3.1 | 6.5, 3.1 | 3.5, 2.2 | 3.3     |
| Meta            | 0.9      | 1.1      | 0.9      | 1.4      | 1.075   |
| TypographicGrid | 1.8      | 0.8      | 1        | 0.7      | 1.075   |
```

It seems they all worth memoized in this context. However this feature needs more reasearch.

## Caching functions

By definition `useMemo(() => memoizedValue(a, b), [a, b])` :

> Will only recompute the memoized value when one of the dependencies has changed. This optimization helps to avoid expensive calculations on every render.

In other words:

> useMemo allows you to memoize the results of a function, and will return that result until an array of dependencies change.

Again one could ask: why don't wrap every function into a `useMemo()`? The answer is:

> Don’t do anything there that you wouldn’t normally do while rendering. For example, side effects belong in useEffect, not useMemo.

In other words: just expensive calculations, no business logic. And hooks are business logic. They can't be memoized.

### Example

In the `LoadingDataApiAxios` component while the data is loading a placeholder is displayed:

```
/**
 * Loads the data
 */
const { data } = useDataAPI(
  ArticlesPlaceholder(placeholder),
  "http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=redux",
  "hits"
);
```

The `placeholder` prop is constant &mdash; is defined as a proptype and never gets touched. That makes the `ArticlesPlaceholder` function ideal to be wrapped into a `useMemo`:

```
/**
 * Creates the placeholder
 */
const articlesPlaceholder = useMemo(() => ArticlesPlaceholder(placeholder), [
  placeholder
]);

/**
 * Loads the data
 */
const { data } = useDataAPI(
  articlesPlaceholder,
  "http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=redux",
  "hits"
);
```

The number of re-renders before `useMemo` was three; now is a single one. That's great but [not sure](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/usememo-and-usecallback) if it reduces the component load speed!

Let's measure it with React profiler:

```
| Articles | Load #1 | Load #2 | Load #3 | Load #4 | Average |
| -----------------------------------------------------------|
| no memo  | 5.8     | 3.2     | 3.5     | 3.8     | 4.075   |
| useMemo  | 3.8     | 4.2     | 3.8     | 4.4     | 4.05    |
```

## Caching callbacks

By definition:

> `useCallback(fn, deps)` is equivalent to `useMemo(() => fn, deps)`

This makes the rules of `useMemo` apply here too:

1. Use only for expensive calculations
2. Cannot contain hooks inside

Why two equivalent constructs with different names?
Perhaps because:

> This is useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders.

In other words `useCallback` should be used when passing callbacks to children. Perhaps it's a way to force optimized callback usage.

### Example

[Headway.io](https://headway.io/blog/react-optimize-components-memo-usememo-usecallback/) has a concrete example:

```
const Parent = () => {
	const [showExtraDetails, setShowExtraDetails] = useState(false);

	return (
		<Child onClick={() => { showData(showExtraDetails); }/>
	);
}
```

> This component will cause Child to re-render every time Parent does, even if Child is a PureComponent or wrapped in React.memo, because the onClick will be different every render. useCallback can handle this situation like so:

```
const Parent = () => {
	const [showExtraDetails, setShowExtraDetails] = useState(false);

	const handleClick = useCallback(
	  () => {
	    showData(showExtraDetails);
	  },
	  [showExtraDetails],
	);

	return (
		<Child onClick={handleClick}/>
	);
}
```

> Now handleClick will have the same value until showExtraDetails changes, which will reduce the number of times Child renders.
